-function parameters allow us to do the same function over and over again
-we "call" a function by its name, set of parentheses, and any data added in as a parameter
-void:dont havt return a value
-return:returns a the value back
-scope of a variable means the area of the program which the variable will be usable
-variables will be callable only within when the functions where u create them
-globale variables are declared at the top of the program(have no indentation)
	-can be accessed anywhere in class
1. You begin writing a program by defining a function. A program file consists of smaller 
mechanisms that work together. You dont need fancy development software because some code is universal.
2. A method needs to be at the top of the programs because it can define other functions below it.
Python runs lines of code by defing it on the top and then your functions at the bottom, telling
it what to do. 
3. we need parameters topass data into the function from the outside. They enhance our use of methods by
making it possible to perform the same function over and over again.
4 The difference bettween a return methods and other methods is that return methods return our value back
while another method(void) doesnt return the calue back to use. 


Data Types
-str: represents text
-integer:carry no fractional(decimal) part and can be negative or positive.
-float:datatype of decimal number
-list:basic structure of python. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number its position or index
-tuple:sequence of immutable objects. Tuples cannot be changed and they use parentheses where lists use brackets
+:adds values on either side of the operator
-:subtracts right hand operad from left hand operand
*:multiplies values of either side of the operator
/:divides left hand operand by right hand operand
%:divides left hand operand from right hand operand and returns the remainder
**:performds exponential calculations on operators
//:Floor division- the division on operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal
 point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored ,i.e., rounded away from zero 
(towards negative infinity).
